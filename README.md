# Robust_Address_Parsing_using_Viterbi_Algorithm
•Implemented Viterbi algorithm using python language for robust address parsing on Australian address dataset. Further extended the above project to account for top-k elements only. Doing this, you cannot check more than the top k probabilities for new set of probabilities, hence limiting the number of computations. The tie breaker was defined as the data came in ascending order of states. This helped save the path that we planned to take for every stage instead of backtracking where we could have lost information on the way while pruning states.  •Outputted the best sequence of hidden states that gave us the corresponding sequence of observed states (i.e. address symbols) with their log probability. The observations along the hidden states were based on Hidden Markov Model.
